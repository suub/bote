;; We have evaluated our ocr results on 200 pages of ground truth text.
;; With the error-codes library, we have extracted all the errors from
;; these 200 pages Now in a postprocessing step, we want to optimize the
;; results of the ocr-engine by going over the ocr text with
;; a) a list of allowed words with their probability
;; b) probabilities that characters xyz in the ocr-results are really xyz
;; in the ground truth.
;; from this two probabilities we can deduce the most probable word from
;; the ocr-results and hope to get less errors after this postprocessing
;; step.  Therefore, it is important to have accurate character
;; recognition probabilities, and this is it that we want to extract now

;; say we have the following ocr-results and ground-truth
(def ocr-results
  "Diescr Teset rnacht wenig Siun")

(def ground-truth
  "Dieser Text macht wenig Sinn")

;; Es wurden die folgenden Ersetzungen von ground-truth nach
;; ocr-results gemacht

;;that "rnacht" is  "macht" or "nacht".
;;Therefore we now build up a statistics with what probability the
;;character (sequence) in the ocr-results was correctly identified or
;;with wich probabilities it was recognized as something different.
;;As example, look at the letter c
;;number of c's in te ocr-results is

(count (filter #{\c} ocr-results))
;;=> 2

;;we need a function here to calculate these in the general case
;;because we are looking to m-to-n substitutions, we have to count
;;the occurences of a substring in a string.

;;WARNING: Note that the sum of the probabilities for the

;;cs is not neccesary equal to 1. The reason is that cs could be a
;;part of a bigger ccs that also occurs in the errors. Then the number
;;of occurrences of cs in the errors is bigger than the count of all
;;entries [xyz cs] in errors, what is what the substitution
;;probabilities count!
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

;;like described in the warning above, the substitution probability
;;that cs is sc in the ground truth text is the number of entries
